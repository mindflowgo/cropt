# Cropt v2 - lightweight JavaScript image cropper
[Github](https://github.com/mindflowgo/cropt/)

**Significant** code cleanup, and feature build-out from the original cropt by **Devtheorem**,without breaking backward compatibility, nor significantly increasing size. 

**Includes distribution version for esm, commonjs, and browser install unlike the original.**

Core new features:
- we have **lots** more demos than the original
- viewport adjustment (adjust the size of the crop image)
- rotation (rotate the image)
- rotate buttons (buttons to rotate the image)

Originally based on [Foliotek/Croppie](https://github.com/Foliotek/Croppie), but rewritten as a modern ES module with a simpler API, higher quality image scaling, and numerous other improvements by [Devtheorem](https://devtheorem.github.io/cropt/).


## Quick Start

- Look at the /docs directory for examples.
- Try our [codepen](https://codepen.io/mindflowgo/pen/QwEbegE).

## Installation

```
npm install cropt2
```

## Running Demo
See the same demos on github: [https://mindflowgo.github.io/cropt/](https://mindflowgo.github.io/cropt/).

1) [Optional] The run build prepares the distribution files if you modify the src files.
2) To see the demos running locally  `npm start`.

```
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Include the `cropt.min.css` stylesheet on your page.
2. Add a `div` element to your HTML to hold the Cropt instance.
3. Import Cropt and bind it to an image:

```javascript
import Cropt from "cropt2";

const presets = {};
const cropt = new Cropt(document.getElementById('demo'), presets);
cropt.bind("path/to/image.jpg");
```

### Sizing

The Cropt boundary requires a minimum height of 100px but otherwise it will adjust to the size 
of the container it is in. If toolbar (rotate, zoom) features, it builds a 32px high toolbar at 
the bottom.

## Options

### `viewport`

Type: `{ width: number, height: number, borderRadius: string }`  
Default value: `{ width: [container]-60px, height: [container]-60px, borderRadius: "0px" }`

Defines the size and shape of the crop box.
For a circle shape, set the border radius to `"50%"`.

### `enableZoomSlider`

Type: `boolean`
Default value: `true`

Toggle if hiding the zoom slider.

### `enableKeypress`

Type: `boolean`
Default value: `true`

Toggle if allow listening for keyboard arrow keys for moving image. Will ignore if active element is a user input one (input box, text area, button).

### `resizeBars`

Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

Optionally to show resize handles (grab-bars) to adjust the viewport width/height.

### `enableRotateBtns`

Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

Toggle if showing rotation buttons beside the zoom slider bar. If both are off (enableZoomSlider and this), the toolbar is hidden.

### `mouseWheelZoom`

Type: `"off" | "on" | "ctrl"`  
Default value: `"on"`

If set to `"off"`, the mouse wheel cannot be used to zoom in and out of the image. If set to `"ctrl"`, the mouse wheel will only zoom in and out while the CTRL key is pressed.

### `zoomerInputClass`

Type: `string`  
Default value: `"cr-slider"`

Optionally set a different class on the zoom range input to customize styling (e.g. set to `"form-range"` when using Bootstrap).


## Methods

### `bind(src: string, preset: number | { transform, viewport }): Promise<void>`

Takes an image URL as the first argument, and an optional initial zoom value OR preset restore data for image placement in viewport. Returns a `Promise` which resolves when the image has been loaded and state is initialized.

### `destroy(): void`

Deconstructs a Cropt instance and removes the elements from the DOM.

### `refresh(): void`

Recalculate points for the image. Necessary if the instance was initially bound to a hidden element.

### `toCanvas(size: number | null = null): Promise<HTMLCanvasElement>`

Returns a `Promise` resolving to an `HTMLCanvasElement` object for the cropped image. If `size` is specified, the cropped image will be scaled with its longest side set to this value.

### `toBlob(size: number | null = null, type = "image/webp", quality = 1): Promise<Blob>`

Returns a Promise resolving to a `Blob` object for the cropped image. If `size` is specified, the cropped image will be scaled with its longest side set to this value. The `type` and `quality` parameters are passed directly to the corresponding [HTMLCanvasElement.toBlob()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toBlob) method parameters.

### `get(): { crop: { left, top, right, bottom }, transform: { x, y, scale, rotate, origin: {x, y}}, viewport: { width, height, borderRadius } }`
Returns information about the current crop state (all `numbers`):

- crop: Crop coordinates on the original image (left, top, right, bottom in pixels). (Note: if rotation present, image must be rotated FIRST then crop coordinates will apply)
- transform: Information for re-placement of image within viewport
- viewport: Final viewport dimensions and styling (width, height, borderRadius)

Useful for server-side cropping or saving user selections.

### `setOptions(options: CroptOptions): void`

Allows options to be dynamically changed on an existing Cropt instance.

### `setZoom(value: number): void`

Set the zoom of a Cropt instance. The value must be between 0 and 1, and is restricted to the min/max set by Cropt.

### `setRotation(value: number): void`

Set a rotation factor (0, 90, 180, 270) to the image.

## Visibility and binding

Cropt is dependent on its container being **visible** when the bind method is called. This can be an issue when your component is inside a modal or block that isn't shown (ex. style = display:none).

If you have issues getting the correct result, and your Cropt instance is shown inside a modal, try taking it out of the modal and see if the issue persists. If not, make sure that your bind method is called after the modal finishes opening.

If a Cropt instance needs to be hidden and then re-shown, call the `refresh()` method to recalculate properties for the displayed image.

## Browser support

Cropt is tested in the following browsers:

* Firefox
* Safari
* Chrome
* Edge
* Mobile Safari

Cropt should also work in any other modern browser using an engine based on Gecko, WebKit, or Chromium.
